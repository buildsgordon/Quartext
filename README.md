# Philosophy

Quartext isn’t designed for heavy research or long documents.
It's always there when you need it, and it will always work, even without wifi!

⚠️ Known Issues:
Some cases require clicking a “broken” line and clicking off to correct rendering.

Collapsed header states aren’t preserved after reload.

We’d love your feedback!
